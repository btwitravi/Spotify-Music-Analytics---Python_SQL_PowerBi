# 🎵 Spotify Music Analytics — End-to-End Data Project
This project is an **end-to-end data pipeline** built using **Python, SQL, Power BI**, and **ETL techniques** to analyze trends in Spotify music such as artist popularity, track performance, genre influence, album types, and yearly release patterns. The goal is to uncover meaningful insights that support **playlist curation, artist promotion**, and **content strategy**.

## 🧩 1. Business Problem
Spotify hosts millions of tracks and thousands of artists, making it difficult to understand:
- Which **artists, songs, and genres** drive the most engagement
- How **album types** (single/album/compilation) perform
- Which songs achieve high **popularity scores**
- How the **music industry has evolved** year by year
- What patterns influence track performance and user listening behavior

This project analyzes Spotify data to support **data-driven decision making** for content strategy, marketing, and playlist recommendations.

## 🎯 2. Objectives
- Build a complete **ETL pipeline** for Spotify dataset
- Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to identify trends
- Understand **top-performing tracks, albums, artists, genres**
 - Analyze **distribution patterns** and **correlations**
- Study **yearly release trends** in the music industry
- Create a **Power BI dashboard** for interactive insights
